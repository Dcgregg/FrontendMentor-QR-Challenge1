## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I have to go to MDN doctumentation to make sure that I'm getting the properties correct. This was a challenge. I decided to do this via just HTML and CSS rather than bootstrap.

### Continued development

I plan to get over imposter syndrome, learning that it's okay not to know everything and that it's important to try and to check the doctumentation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me to make sure that I was getting the correct selector and helped centre align the card to the centre of the screen.
